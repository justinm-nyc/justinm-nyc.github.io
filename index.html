       <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
       <p> My name is Justin Martinelli and I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University Of Massachusetts Amherst.  Since helping people with their computer issues since a young child, to building and programming robots in high school, my passion for technology has only grown stronger.</p>
       <p>  I use Java as my main tool for solving problems.  Seeing my hard work manifest into reality is one of the things that makes me content in life. Front end development is what most interests me. I have a thirst for learning and only seek to quench this thirst. I am looking to accumulate more skils and improve my already aquired ones by constantly working on new projects. </p>
